I wish...that I could go back and change things...
I wish that I could go back to before it all went wrong...
Forgive me.
The higurashi continued to sing their song.
Keiichi! Wake up!
I stirred from my slumber, yawning as I rubbed my eyes.
Slowly, the nightmare I had just awoken from faded from my mind.

I guess I should go down and eat breakfast. Rena-chan will be here soon to pick me up.
My mom laid breakfast out on the table. Seaweed, pickled vegetables, raw egg, and grilled salmon.
The platonic ideal of a Japanese breakfast. But my mother was not finished.
To her, no breakfast would be complete without a steaming bowl of miso soup.
She walked over with the soup, eyes shining, all while humming a little tune.
She must be in a good mood today.
You haven't skipped breakfast once since we moved to Hinamizawa. I'm so proud of you.
Let me explain.
My name is Maebara Keiichi.
It has been three weeks since my family moved to the small village of Hinamizawa, and, honestly, I can't believe it belongs to the same country as the city I used to live in.
In fact, I have a hard time believing that it belongs to the same time period...
Yeah~ Your cooking is just that delicious!
Back when we lived in the city, I was never a morning person. My parents were lucky if they saw me before I left for school.
Boycotting breakfast was my way of fighting back against my parents, who forced me to go to cram school.
Taking another bite of the grilled salmon, I sighed with satisfaction.
If I could go back in time, I would slap myself for ignoring all the hard work my mom put into those breakfasts.
Anyways, waking up early now was no issue, now that I no longer attended cram school.
I guess the country air helps too.
Keiichi! Isn't it almost time for you to meet up with Rena-chan? Hurry, hurry!
Mom seemed to enjoy the fact that I was walking to school with a girl.
That girl is named Ryuugu Rena. She is one of my classmates.
Every day since moving to Hinamizawa, Rena has shown up in the morning to walk me to school.
She and mom hit it off too. Rena would come over every so often with home-grown vegetables, and my mom was alwzys appreciative of her kindness.
Keiichi! Rena-chan is waiting!
I shoveled the remainder of my breakfast down my throat and hopped up from the table.
After giving thanks to my mother, I ran out the door to meet up with Rena. As I left, my mom yelled out the door.
Have a safe trip! Don't forget to thank Rena-Chan for the vegetables!
Haha, will do!
